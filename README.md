# PID-motor-control-system-simulink

# project overview:
This project represent a closed loop control system simulation using matlab simulink software tool. Control system designer is used to tune the critcal gain parameter "K_cr" and critcal period. Using ziegler nichols method,pid parameters are calculated. Simulating the system with simulink tunner using for more enhanced respone.

# Motor load:
In addition to motor load torque, external torqur is added to system related to the load which the motor had to drive.
# results:
PID parameters for speed and position contro.
Motor required starting torque for different speed cases. knowing the highest speed value can the motor drive due to its stall torque.
